# GregTech Nuclear Power

<hr>

## A semi-realistic nuclear power addon
While less intricate than nuclear power in nuclearcraft, ic2 or MI; this addon seeks to provide an interesting power generation.

### Fuel
Make nuclear fuel from thorium, uranium, plutonium or naquadah

### Moderators
Use moderators to increase heat generation from the fuel used and use the heat to run turbines

### KJS integration
The aim is to allow pack devs to add custom fuels, complete with raw and depleted composition, neutron generation and duration, custom moderators for the intended progression; and (from vanilla GT) custom turbines for conversion of heat to power
